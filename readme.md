# Polyrhythm Calculator

[Use the Polyrhythm Calculator PWA](https://stellartux.github.io/polyrhythm-calculator/)

Inspired by [this Yogev Gabay video](https://youtu.be/LGB-7viJrv0).

The Polyrhythm Calculator is also available to embed in your own web page as a Custom Element.

Add this at the end of your page's `<head>`.

```html
<script
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stellartux/polyrhythm-calculator/polyrhythm-calculator.js"
  type="module"
></script>
```

The `<polyrhythm-calculator>` element is contained within that file, copy it if you'd prefer to host it alongside your own code.

Add this somewhere in your page's `<body>`.

```html
<polyrhythm-calculator></polyrhythm-calculator>
```

That's it!
